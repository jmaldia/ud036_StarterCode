## Movie Trailer Website

Source code for a Movie Trailer website. This program creates instances of a Movie class by providing the movie title, poster art, and trailer. The instances are used to build a website that displays posters and titles of favorite movies. When you click on a movie poster or title, it plays a trailer of that movie on a Modal within the webpage. 


## Files included

**media.py** - This is where the Movie class is defined. The Movie class helps in storing information about the movie objects that you create. 

**fresh_tomatoes.py** - Contains the methods that helps build the website. It also contains the styles for our site.

**entertainment_center.py** - This contains all the movie objects that we will be displaying on our website. It also calls on the fresh_tomatoes.py file in order for it to create our page.
